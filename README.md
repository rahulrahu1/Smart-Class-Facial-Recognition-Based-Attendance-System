The project is a real-time face attendance system integrating computer vision and Firebase 
technologies. Utilizing OpenCV and face_recognition library, the system captures live video feed, 
recognizes faces, and marks attendance by comparing detected faces with pre-encoded faces stored in 
a Firebase database. The application employs a variety of image processing techniques for optimal 
performance, including face localization, encoding, and background image manipulation. 

Firebase serves as the backend, managing real-time student data storage, retrieval, and image storage 
in the cloud. The attendance logic incorporates different modes, allowing dynamic adaptation to 
classroom scenarios. The graphical user interface (GUI) displays the live video feed, recognized faces, 
and pertinent student information. The system includes a comprehensive mode-switching mechanism 
and a 30-second reset timer for efficient and accurate attendance tracking. 

The project aims to streamline attendance management in educational institutions, offering an 
automated and reliable solution that enhances efficiency and reduces manual workload. Future 
enhancements may include additional features for improved user interaction and expanded 
functionality.
